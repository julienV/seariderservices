The sale and purchase of shipping assets is often closely linked with a charter requirement. In addition to outright purchases, either from newbuilding shipyards or existing second hand tonnage, we have experience working on purchases after a long-term Time Charter or Bareboat Charter agreement. We can work with a newly built specific type of vessel or on existing second hand tonnage. 

We have strong relationships with an established network of shipowners and selected shipyards, giving us the flexibility to adjust requirements.
