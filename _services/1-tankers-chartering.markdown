Searider Services is specialised in small tanker chartering, product and chemical tankers, bitumen tankers and bunkering tankers. 
We handle all types of liquid bulk cargoes, including  petroleum products, chemicals, vegoils and liquid foodstuffs on multipurpose or specialised vessels. 

We monitor the charter market, vessel positions and cargo flow and identify the right tankers for the right trade. 
Our approach is overarching and global, not only per geographical area.

We identify and select the best vessels and charters requirements, guide and conclude fixture negotiation, and follow vessel operations until the charter is ended and all possible pending issues have been resolved.
